## Collecting Your Personal Information/Data

Warp Dash does not in any way collect or store your information. Your information is not saved on any Warp Dash servers, nor is it sold or given to third parties.

Warp Dash does not require creating an account for you to access it. You simply download it and play it without use of your Personal Data. Any information is sent to the Google Play Store and not to us.

This also applies to achievement scoreboards displayed on Google Play Games or social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, X, etc. Only your username as it appears on Google Play Store or Google Play Games, as the case may be, will appear on the achievement scoreboards without your information coming to and being used by us.

## Business Transactions

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition or sale, the achievement scoreboard which contains your username as it appears on Google Play Games may be transferred. We will provide notice before it is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

---

## Law Enforcement

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your username as it appears on the Google Play Store or Google Play Games if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).

## Other Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information as it appears on Google Play Store or Google Play Games in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation  
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company  
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with playing Warp Dash  
- Protect the personal safety of users of the Game or the public

## Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your Personal Data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Detailed information on the processing of your personal data by the service provider(s) we use, namely Google Play Store, may have access to your Personal Data. It may collect, store, use, process, and transfer information about your activity on our Game in accordance with their Privacy Policies.
